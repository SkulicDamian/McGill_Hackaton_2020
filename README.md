Using OpenCV to make low pixelated images into high pixelated ones
Using this blog as an inspiration and as guidance with our project https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-based-super-resolution-with-opencv-4fd736678066

We want to increase the resolution of pictures coming from space, using some of the latest AI algorithms.

We are using OpenCV to upscale the image

We are feeding the image to different pre trained models

testing 4 different models “edsr”, “fsrcnn”, “lapsrn”, “espcn”
